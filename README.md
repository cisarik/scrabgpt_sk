# ScrabGPT

Cross‚Äëplatform Python desktop app to play Scrabble vs **GPT‚Äë5‚Äëmini** with multi-model AI support and agent-based gameplay.

MVP demonstrates:
- clean domain core (board, scoring, rules),
- **structured** OpenAI calls (AI player + batched judge),
- **async agent system** with background execution and real-time progress tracking,
- **unified settings dialog** with tabbed interface and green theme,
- **agent activity monitoring** with non-blocking dialogs and toolbar animations,
- PySide6 UI with thread-safe signal/slot architecture,
- TDD for scoring and rules.

## Quick start (Poetry)
```bash
poetry install
cp .env.example .env  # add your keys
poetry run python -m scrabgpt.ui.app
```

> All OpenAI requests/responses are pretty-printed to the terminal (key masked).
> Agent activities are tracked in real-time with OpenAI-style animations.

## AI player prompt rules

- The AI must not ‚Äúglue‚Äù its letters to adjacent existing strings unless the entire resulting contiguous main string is a valid English word. Prefer proper hooks/intersections.
- The returned `word` must exactly match the final main word formed on the board (existing letters + placements).

## Repro mode (deterministic TileBag)

To reproduce games or debug reliably:

1. Open Settings (‚öôÔ∏è), enable "Repro m√≥d" and set an integer "Seed".
2. Start a new game (üÜï). When enabled, the tile bag is created as `TileBag(seed=<seed>)`.
3. Each new game logs `game_start seed=<X> repro=<true|false>` to console and `scrabgpt.log`.

This is runtime-only; no values are persisted to `.env`.

## Agent System with Background Execution

ScrabGPT features a sophisticated async agent system for background operations:

### Key Features
- **Non-blocking dialogs**: Agents Dialog can be closed while operations continue in background
- **Real-time progress tracking**: OpenAI-style animations with fading text and animated dots
- **Thread-safe architecture**: Qt signals/slots for safe cross-thread communication
- **Progress callbacks**: Agents report thinking process, status updates, and results
- **Toolbar integration**: Animated status widget shows current agent activity
- **Multiple concurrent agents**: Global agent dispatcher tracks all running agents

### Components

#### Agents Dialog (`scrabgpt/ui/agents_dialog.py`)
- Tabbed interface with one tab per agent
- Activity log showing thinking process
- Progress bar and status updates
- Response viewer with results
- Can be closed anytime - agents continue in background

#### Language Agent (`scrabgpt/ai/language_agent.py`)
- Async/await MCP pattern implementation
- Fetches supported languages from OpenAI API
- Uses `asyncio.to_thread()` for blocking operations
- Progress callbacks at each step
- 1-hour caching for efficiency

#### Agent Status Widget (`scrabgpt/ui/agent_status_widget.py`)
- OpenAI-style fading animation
- Shows "ü§ñ Agent: Status..." with animated dots (1-3 cycling)
- Auto-hides after completion (2 second delay)
- Smooth fade in/out with QPropertyAnimation

### Thread Safety
All agent operations use proper Qt threading patterns:
```python
# Worker thread emits signals (thread-safe)
worker.progress_update.emit(update)

# Main thread receives via signal/slot (safe for UI updates)
worker.progress_update.connect(on_progress_handler)
```

Workers are owned by MainWindow (`agent_workers` dict), not dialogs, ensuring they survive dialog closure.

### Usage Example
```python
# Create agent
agent = LanguageAgent()

# Create worker with auto-injected progress callback
worker = AsyncAgentWorker(
    agent.fetch_languages,
    use_cache=False,
    min_languages=40
)

# Connect signals
worker.progress_update.connect(on_progress)
worker.agent_finished.connect(on_finished)
worker.agent_error.connect(on_error)

# Start in background
worker.start()

# Dialog can be closed - worker continues!
```

### Settings Integration
- **Auto-show agents**: `SHOW_AGENT_ACTIVITY_AUTO=true` in `.env`
- Settings accessible from "‚öôÔ∏è Nastavenia" toolbar button
- 4 tabs: V≈°eobecn√©, AI Protivn√≠k, Nastavenia API, Upravi≈• prompt protihr√°ƒça
- Green forest theme matching game aesthetic

## Save/Load

ScrabGPT supports saving and loading the full game state to JSON.

- schema_version: "1"
- grid: 15 strings of length 15 ('.' or 'A'..'Z')
- blanks: positions where a blank tile was used
- premium_used: positions where board premiums were consumed
- human_rack, ai_rack: letters currently on racks
- bag: exact order of remaining tiles
- human_score, ai_score, turn
- optional: last_move_cells, last_move_points, consecutive_passes, repro, seed

Notes:
- The format is versioned and future migrations may be introduced. Always check `schema_version`.
- No secrets are stored in save files.

## Changelist - Recent Features & Improvements

### Agent System & Background Execution (Latest)
- **Unified Settings Dialog**: Tabbed interface with 4 tabs (V≈°eobecn√©, AI Protivn√≠k, Nastavenia API, Upravi≈• prompt)
- **Agents Activity Dialog**: Non-blocking dialog showing real-time agent progress, thinking, and results
- **Agent Status Widget**: Toolbar animation with OpenAI-style fading text and animated dots
- **Language Agent**: Async implementation fetching supported languages with progress callbacks
- **Background Execution**: Agents continue running when dialogs closed (workers owned by MainWindow)
- **Thread-Safe UI Updates**: Qt signals/slots pattern prevents UI freezing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates with timestamps in activity log
- **Green Theme Consistency**: All dialogs match forest green aesthetic
- **Click-to-Open**: Clickable status bar in settings opens agents dialog even when modal
- **Auto-Show Config**: SHOW_AGENT_ACTIVITY_AUTO environment variable controls visibility

### Multi-Model AI Support
