# ScrabGPT

Cross‚Äëplatform Python desktop app to play Scrabble vs **GPT‚Äë5‚Äëmini**.  
MVP demonstrates:
- clean domain core (board, scoring, rules),
- **structured** OpenAI calls (AI player + batched judge),
- PySide6 UI,
- TDD for scoring and rules.

## Quick start (Poetry)
```bash
poetry install
cp .env.example .env  # add your key
poetry run python -m scrabgpt.ui.app
```

> All OpenAI requests/responses are pretty-printed to the terminal (key masked).

## AI player prompt rules

- The AI must not ‚Äúglue‚Äù its letters to adjacent existing strings unless the entire resulting contiguous main string is a valid English word. Prefer proper hooks/intersections.
- The returned `word` must exactly match the final main word formed on the board (existing letters + placements).

## Repro mode (deterministic TileBag)

To reproduce games or debug reliably:

1. Open Settings (‚öôÔ∏è), enable "Repro m√≥d" and set an integer "Seed".
2. Start a new game (üÜï). When enabled, the tile bag is created as `TileBag(seed=<seed>)`.
3. Each new game logs `game_start seed=<X> repro=<true|false>` to console and `scrabgpt.log`.

This is runtime-only; no values are persisted to `.env`.

## Save/Load

ScrabGPT supports saving and loading the full game state to JSON.

- schema_version: "1"
- grid: 15 strings of length 15 ('.' or 'A'..'Z')
- blanks: positions where a blank tile was used
- premium_used: positions where board premiums were consumed
- human_rack, ai_rack: letters currently on racks
- bag: exact order of remaining tiles
- human_score, ai_score, turn
- optional: last_move_cells, last_move_points, consecutive_passes, repro, seed

Notes:
- The format is versioned and future migrations may be introduced. Always check `schema_version`.
- No secrets are stored in save files.
