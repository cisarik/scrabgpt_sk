# ScrabGPT

Cross‚Äëplatform Python desktop app to play Scrabble against multiple AI models at once.

Supports OpenRouter and Novita reasoning providers, persists team presets per provider, and ships
with tooling to bootstrap localized variants from Wikipedia data.

MVP demonstrates:
- clean domain core (board, scoring, rules),
- **structured** OpenAI calls (AI player + batched judge),
- **async agent system** with background execution and real-time progress tracking,
- **unified settings dialog** with tabbed interface and green theme,
- **agent activity monitoring** with non-blocking dialogs and toolbar animations,
- PySide6 UI with thread-safe signal/slot architecture,
- TDD for scoring and rules.

## Quick start (Poetry)
```bash
poetry install
cp .env.example .env  # add your keys
poetry run python -m scrabgpt.ui.app
```

> All OpenAI requests/responses are pretty-printed to the terminal (key masked).
> Agent activities are tracked in real-time with OpenAI-style animations.

## Multi-provider AI setup
- `OpenRouter`: keep `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`, configure models in **Nastavenia ‚Üí AI
  Protivn√≠k**, and use the multi-model dialog to pick up to 10 competitors.
- `Novita`: add `NOVITA_API_KEY`, optional `NOVITA_MAX_TOKENS`, and
  `NOVITA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; select **Novita AI** in the same settings tab to launch the
  dedicated model browser with reasoning metadata.
- `Teams`: selections persist under `~/.scrabgpt/teams/*.json`; the app loads them on
  startup and also restores the last opponent mode from `~/.scrabgpt/config.json`.
- Docs: see `docs/NOVITA_INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/NOVITA_QUICKSTART.md`, and
  `docs/PERSISTENCE_FIX.md` for setup, troubleshooting, and persistence details.

## AI player prompt rules

- The AI may hook onto existing strings only when the resulting main word is valid; avoid glueing.
- The returned `word` must equal the final main word on the board (existing letters + placements).

## Repro mode (deterministic TileBag)

To reproduce games or debug reliably:

1. Open Settings (‚öôÔ∏è), enable "Repro m√≥d" and set an integer "Seed".
2. Start a new game (üÜï). When enabled, the tile bag is created as `TileBag(seed=<seed>)`.
3. Each new game logs `game_start seed=<X> repro=<true|false>` to console and `scrabgpt.log`.

This is runtime-only; no values are persisted to `.env`.

## Agent System with Background Execution

ScrabGPT features a sophisticated async agent system for background operations:

### Key Features
- **Non-blocking dialogs**: Agents Dialog can be closed while operations continue in background
- **Real-time progress tracking**: OpenAI-style animations with fading text and animated dots
- **Thread-safe architecture**: Qt signals/slots for safe cross-thread communication
- **Progress callbacks**: Agents report thinking process, status updates, and results
- **Toolbar integration**: Animated status widget shows current agent activity
- **Multiple concurrent agents**: Global agent dispatcher tracks all running agents

### Components

#### Agents Dialog (`scrabgpt/ui/agents_dialog.py`)
- Tabbed interface with one tab per agent
- Activity log showing thinking process
- Progress bar and status updates
- Response viewer with results
- Can be closed anytime - agents continue in background

#### Language Agent (`scrabgpt/ai/language_agent.py`)
- Async/await MCP pattern implementation
- Fetches supported languages from OpenAI API
- Uses `asyncio.to_thread()` for blocking operations
- Progress callbacks at each step
- 1-hour caching for efficiency

#### Agent Status Widget (`scrabgpt/ui/agent_status_widget.py`)
- OpenAI-style fading animation
- Shows "ü§ñ Agent: Status..." with animated dots (1-3 cycling)
- Auto-hides after completion (2 second delay)
- Smooth fade in/out with QPropertyAnimation

### Thread Safety
All agent operations use proper Qt threading patterns:
```python
# Worker thread emits signals (thread-safe)
worker.progress_update.emit(update)

# Main thread receives via signal/slot (safe for UI updates)
worker.progress_update.connect(on_progress_handler)
```

Workers live in MainWindow's `agent_workers` dict so they survive dialog closures.

### Usage Example
```python
# Create agent
agent = VariantBootstrapAgent()

# Create worker with auto-injected progress callback
worker = AsyncAgentWorker(
    agent.bootstrap,
    force_refresh=True,
)

# Connect signals
worker.progress_update.connect(on_progress)
worker.agent_finished.connect(on_finished)
worker.agent_error.connect(on_error)

# Start in background
worker.start()

# Dialog can be closed - worker continues!
```

### Settings Integration
- **Auto-show agents**: `SHOW_AGENT_ACTIVITY_AUTO=true` in `.env`
- Settings accessible from "‚öôÔ∏è Nastavenia" toolbar button
- 4 tabs: V≈°eobecn√©, AI Protivn√≠k, Nastavenia API, Upravi≈• prompt protihr√°ƒça
- Green forest theme matching game aesthetic

## Variant bootstrap pipeline
- `VariantBootstrapAgent` turns Wikipedia Scrabble tables into JSON-like summaries for each
  language while streaming progress through the Agents dialog.
- `wiki_loader.py` caches the source page at
  `scrabgpt/assets/variants/wikipedia_scrabble_cache.html` for offline parsing.
- Generated summaries live in `scrabgpt/assets/variants/lang_summarizations/` (gitignored) and
  seed future variant definitions.
- Tooling: `tools/parse_wikipedia_languages.py`, `tools/test_novita.py`, and
  `tools/test_teams.py` exercise the new pipelines and persistence logic.
- Tests: `tests/test_variant_agent.py` plus updates to agent, model, and opponent selector tests
  cover parsing edge cases, persistence, and Novita provider flows.

## Save/Load

ScrabGPT supports saving and loading the full game state to JSON.

- schema_version: "1"
- grid: 15 strings of length 15 ('.' or 'A'..'Z')
- blanks: positions where a blank tile was used
- premium_used: positions where board premiums were consumed
- human_rack, ai_rack: letters currently on racks
- bag: exact order of remaining tiles
- human_score, ai_score, turn
- optional: last_move_cells, last_move_points, consecutive_passes, repro, seed

Notes:
- The format is versioned and future migrations may be introduced. Always check `schema_version`.
- No secrets are stored in save files.
